Some notes regarding Minor Release and code

-The jar file only runs on Linux and you can run it on a linux machine 
 using this command
 "java -jar blokus.jar"
-The jar file included has some couple GUI tweaks but the code for 
 functionality of the two use cases is still similar
-We originally were supposed to implement load a game session in our 
 minor release but since to load a game we should first have save a 
 game session in place. Therefore, we decided to change our load a game
 session use case to rotation/flip of a shape.
-We have partially done placing a piece on the board but it still needs
 to have the rules implemented to behave like an actual blokus game which
 ofcourse we plan to do that in the next iteration.
-The included code in minor release folder can be run via the following
 series of command
 "javac *.java"
 "java GUI"
-If you want to see our latest code at anytime feel free to have a look at
 our blokus folder in root directory of this repository.
