Some Notes Regarding Iteration 3

-The jar file only runs on Linux and you can run it on a linux machine 
 using this command
 "java -jar blokus.jar"
-The jar file would not work if you do not have any session saved
 It would stop working if you load it without
-The included code in minor release cannot be run using this command anymore
 because we have included a external jar library called json-simple.
 "javac *.java"
 "java GUI"
-If you want to run the code please open the folder inside "Actual Project"
 in Eclipse and include the json library.
-We are using json to save and load our board data
-When the game starts there will be a black block which is the  starting point
 temporarily to place a shape, this is because we were trying to figure out
 how the rules are going to work, but you can still place the shape like in an 
 actual game of blockus but only on the corners of the  black shape.
-If you want to see our latest code at anytime feel free to have a look at
 our blokus folder in root directory of this repository.
