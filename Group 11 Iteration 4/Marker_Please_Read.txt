Some Notes Regarding Iteration 4 Final release

As told in the last Iteration feedback we have added a back button
in the set up pages. When X is pressed, a popup appears asking For
saving the current game session. All the pages are aligned and 
their controls too. But one fix we couldn't do is that some 
of the buttons do not always work.

The reason why they do not always work is that to register a click the
cursor should be still. If the cursor moves while clicking,the click 
won't be registered. We couldn't fix this but we made sure that when 
a click successfully registers  a sound feedback is given to the user.
So when you click on a shape, some sound should be played.
